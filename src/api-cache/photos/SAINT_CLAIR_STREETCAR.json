He also worked for a \u003cem\u003estreetcar\u003c/em\u003e company. At the time of the interview he worked for the Mason Booth Company. Marcelina Urvina was born Feb. 1, 1918, in Dallas, Texas. Although she was a U.S. citizen, her family had difficulties working in the fields. At age twelve she came to Minnesota with her mother and worked the beet fields near \u003cem\u003eSt\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cem\u003eClair\u003c/em\u003e, Minn., and at the Green Giant Company in Le Sueur, Minn., until she was sixteen. She is now working for Harrison Elementary School as a nurse's aide. Subjects discussed include: Carlos Urvina describes coming to the United States - working for the railroad and as an iron and metal worker - and the beauty of knowing two languages. Marcelina Urvina describes coming to Minnesota - troubles her mother had as a result of not speaking English - working in beet fields - bringing up their children - the importance of a good education - and Mexican customs in the home. Both emphasize the value of education and bilingualism. COMMENTS ON INTERVIEW: In Spanish, transcribed into English.","label":"Description"}},"contributing_organization_tesi":{"id":"https://collection.mndigital.org/catalog/p16022coll548:1342#contributing_organization_tesi","type":"document_value","attributes":{"value":"Minnesota Historical Society","label":"Contributing Institution"}},"type_tesi":{"id":"https://collection.mndigital.org/catalog/p16022coll548:1342#type_tesi","type":"document_value","attributes":{"value":"Sound Recording Nonmusical","label":"Type"}},"physical_format_tesi":{"id":"https://collection.mndigital.org/catalog/p16022coll548:1342#physical_format_tesi","type":"document_value","attributes":{"value":"Oral histories","label":"Format"}}},"links":{"self":"https://collection.mndigital.org/catalog/p16022coll548:1342"}},{"id":"p16022coll35:8","type":"Text","attributes":{"title":"2015 Saint Paul Almanac","dat_tesi":{"id":"https://collection.mndigital.org/catalog/p16022coll35:8#dat_tesi","type":"document_value","attributes":{"value":"2015","label":"Date Created"}},"description_ts":{"id":"https://collection.mndigital.org/catalog/p16022coll35:8#description_ts","type":"document_value","attributes":{"value":"The Saint Paul Almanac is an annual calendar and guide to take the curious urban adventurer through the year of 2015 in Minnesota\u0026#39;s capital city.
